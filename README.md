SimplyEdit is a revolutionary new way of creating and editing websites. It is not just an HTML editor. It is almost a complete CMS (Content Management System) that runs in your browser.

SimplyEdit is designed to be easy to extend. All the visible features are already plugins. You can easily add your own toolbars, page or image storage or replace existing features with your own version. All you need is some Javascript, HTML and CSS knowledge.
